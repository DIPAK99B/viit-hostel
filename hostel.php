<p class = "margin-left-right"> Living in Hostel provides students the freedom to socialize with their
     groups and establish new vistas of friendship and continual rapport with each other. 
     Realistic achievement of this is facilitated by well-furnished and spacious rooms in 
     the girls and boys hostels of the Pratishthan.  Students living in hostels in the campus 
     are provided with separate mess and canteens, where choicest food and cleanliness are the 
     mark of daily living. </p> &nbsp

   <p class = "margin-left-right"> Most of our students live on campus. The new hostels on the VIIT campus underlines the Instituteâ€™s 
    commitment to good design. Every building project the Institute has set standards for other institutes 
    to follow. Throughout the academic year we provide accommodation and catering for our Students and Staff. 
    Each group of three to four students share a room, with separate beds, study tables & chairs. Some rooms have 
    attached shower/bathrooms, while others have a shared one. The details for the same are given along with the admission forms.

Ladies and Gents Hostels have a capacity of 200 and 500 students respectively. Each hostel room has been provided with 
intranet connection through high-speed fiber optic backbone connected directly to the main server of VIIT..</p> &nbsp
